# Photographic

I like square photos. Unquestionably a hobby project.

## Requirements

PostgresSQL should be used as a database.

## Configuring the environment

The following environment variables should be set before running:

```
SECRET_KEY
DB_NAME
DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
```

In production, the following should also be set:

```
MEDIA_ROOT
MEDIA_URL
STATIC_ROOT
STATIC_URL
```
